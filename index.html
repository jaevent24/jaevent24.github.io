    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently an international student from Indonesia, studying Mathematics and computer Science in the University of California San Diego. 
        I transferred to UC San Diego from Diablo Valley College as a Computer Science major. I am mainly proficient in C++ and Julia, and currently learning other languages such as Python and Java.
        Throughout my college career I have been involved in coding Data Science related tasks as well such as importing data from csv files and formatting them in a way that is more readable to analyze and sort out.
        I have a strong understanding of Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures and hope to apply my skills into the professional world.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a person, I have always let my curiosity drive me forward in my career. My interest in learning new things and doing my best in everything I do has led me to where I am now.
        I value trust and commitment above all else and I always make sure to complete my tasks in a complete and punctual manner. 
        I have always found interest in coding and the possibilities that go with it. I find programming as a means for me to create functioning implementations of my ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of my career, I love to aquascape as a hobby and play strategy games. 
        Aquascaping is a means of expressing my artistic side as I enjoy planning out the different scapes that I have in mind and planting different kinds of aquatic plants and watching them grow over time.
        I always found interest in a small aquatic ecosystem in my own home and still keep up to date with the world of aquascaping.
        As for gaming, I enjoy playing Hearthstone as I find it very challenging and fun to engage with.
